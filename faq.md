# PyCaribbean 2017 FAQs

## What is the Code of Conduct?
You can find our Code of Conduct here.

## Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?
There are no age requirements to attend this event. We do ask that minors be accompanied by their legal guardians. The only ID requirement is a photo ID at registration time if you do not have your Eventbrite ticket.

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?
The venue has ample parking onsite. It is also located between two train stops that are only a five minute walk away. 
We will also have transportation provided by the city of Bayam√≥n from the event's partner hotel.
By the conference date Uber should have started operations in Puerto Rico so they might be a suitable alternate form of transportation.

## So what language is the conference going to be in?
English and Spanish will be the "official" languages for the talks. Other than that we love diversity :)

## Will there be vegetarian dishes available at the conference?
Yes. We will cater to your every need as best as we can. If you have any dietary need please let us know at info@pycaribbean.com. You can count on our highest discretion.

## Will there be any extra activities during the conference?
We are still planning them out, but we expect to have a number of local community events and recreational activities prepared. We will be announcing them as they become available.

## Is my registration/ticket transferrable?
Not at the moment but it is something that we can address if the need arises.

## Can I cancel my reservation?
We rather have you with us, but if it's unavoidable you can cancel and get a full refund no later than January 15, 2017.
